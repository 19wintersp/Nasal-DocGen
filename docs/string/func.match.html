check if string &#60;str&#62; matches shell style pattern &#60;patt&#62;

Rules:
?   stands for any single character
*   stands for any number (including zero) of arbitrary characters
\   escapes the next character and makes it stand for itself; that is:
\? stands for a question mark (not the &#34;any single character&#34; placeholder)
[]  stands for a group of characters:
[abc]      stands for letters a, b or c
[^abc]     stands for any character but a, b, and c  (^ as first character -&#62; inversion)
[1-4]      stands for digits 1 to 4 (1, 2, 3, 4)
[1-4-]     stands for digits 1 to 4, and the minus
[-1-4]     same as above
[1-3-6]    stands for digits 1 to 3, minus, and 6
[1-3-6-9]  stands for digits 1 to 3, minus, and 6 to 9
[][]       stands for the closing and the opening bracket (&#39;]&#39; must be first!)
[^^]       stands for all characters but the caret symbol
[\/]       stands for a backslash or a slash  (the backslash isn&#39;t an
escape character in a [] character group)

Note that a minus can&#39;t be a range delimiter, as in [a--e],
which would be interpreted as any of a, e, or minus.

Example:
string.match(name, &#34;*[0-9].xml&#34;); ... true if &#39;name&#39; ends with digit followed by &#34;.xml&#34;
